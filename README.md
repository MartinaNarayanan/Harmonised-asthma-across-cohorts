# Harmonised asthma variables across four CLS cohorts

[Centre for Longitudinal Studies](https://cls.ucl.ac.uk/)

---

## Overview
- This repository provides Stata syntax files that harmonise asthma variables in the [**NCDS**]([https://cls.ucl.ac.uk/cls-studies/1958-national-child-development-study/]),  [**BCS**]([https://cls.ucl.ac.uk/cls-studies/1970-british-cohort-study/]),  [**Next Steps**]([https://cls.ucl.ac.uk/cls-studies/1958-national-child-development-study/]) and [**MCS**]([https://cls.ucl.ac.uk/cls-studies/millennium-cohort-study/]) in a consistent way to enable cross-cohort comparison. 
- We also provide an overview of all variables related to asthma in these four cohort studies (note that only a few of them were used in the derivation of the harmonised asthma variables)
