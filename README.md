# Title [e.g., Next Steps Longitudinal Derived Variable dataset]

[Centre for Longitudinal Studies](https://cls.ucl.ac.uk/)

---

## Overview [high-level summary, e.g. the below]
- This repository provides **R scripts** that harmonise the multiple sweeps of [**Next Steps**](https://cls.ucl.ac.uk/cls-studies/next-steps/) into a single tidy dataset, so analysts can get straight to research rather than recoding. 
- The variables are given consistent names that reflect the content and age of participants (e.g., `Educ25` for **educational** attainment at age 25).

## Included variable domains [give an illustrative overview – no need to duplicate what already exists e.g., in UKDS documentation]

| Domain         | Examples                               |

## Syntax and data availability [tell the user where the syntax is + how source data should be **set up** to run it]

- *Source data:* Download raw Next Steps files from the **UK Data Service** and place them in `data/raw/`.
- *Syntax:* `01_build_dataset.R` reads those files and produces `data/derived/next_steps.parquet` *(note: keep the code well-commented and use **relative** file paths—e.g., `here::here("data", "raw", ...)` in R, or `$raw` / `$derived` globals in Stata).*
- *Derived dataset:* Available to download from the [**UK Data Service**](https://beta.ukdataservice.ac.uk).
